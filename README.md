# lox Compiler Suite

This project contains a C++ implementation of a compiler
and interpreter for the Lox language created by Robert Nystrom following his great book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/).

## Build

You can build the `ilox` binary which provides an interpreter for Lox or `clox` which provides an implementation of a bytecode compiler and VM for Lox.

Good ol' `make` is used to build both `ilox` and `clox`, navigate to the directory for the which project
you want to build and run `make`.
