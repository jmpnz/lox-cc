# lox Compiler Suite

Implementation of an Interpreters and compiler for the Lox language
created by Robert Nystrom in his book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/)

## Usage

```sh

$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake .. && make
```

The build step creates two binaries `lox` the interpreter REPL
and `test` a test runner.
